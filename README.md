## GitHub Student Developer Pack
I am still awaiting my GitHub Student Developer Pack application to get approved, but I have included a screenshot below of my pending submission.

## Version Control
Version control is an essential tool for engineers, even if they are not full-time software developers. It allows for tracking and managing code changes, organizing workflows, and reverting to earlier versions when needed.

**Source Code Management (SCM):**
SCM tools manage modifications to a source code repository and help multiple users collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.

**About Git:**
Git is a widely used version control system that is flexible, efficient, and scalable for all project sizes. A common challenge for new users is its unique terminology and workflow.

**Example Project Reflection:**
Version control would have been very helpful in my ASTE-101 Python project that mapped planetary terrain. My team worked simultaneously in VS Code, and Git could have reduced errors and improved coordination.

## Git from the Command Line
I used **Git Bash** to set up Git, configure my username, and cache GitHub credentials.

### Cloning the Tutorial Repository
Steps I followed:
1. Created a GitHub repository called `hello-world`.
2. Copied the HTTPS link.
3. Opened Git Bash and navigated to my working directory.
4. Ran `git clone <repo-URL>` to download the repo locally.
5. Used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push origin main` to upload my report.

## Git Integration in VS Code
I linked GitHub with VS Code and tested committing, pushing, and viewing diffs from within the IDE.

## Reflection / Workflow Notes
Through this assignment, I learned how Git streamlines the software workflow. It’s essential for version tracking, collaboration, and error recovery.

**Key Commands:**
- `git status`
- `git add <filename>`
- `git commit -m "message"`
- `git push origin main`
